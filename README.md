## Overview

This project is a basic implementation of the Asteroids game where players control a spaceship, navigate through space, and shoot asteroids. The game is built using HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript.

## Features

- Spaceship movement using "WSAD" keys.
- Shooting bullets with the "Space" key.
- Asteroids appear randomly on the screen.
- Collision detection between spaceship, bullets, and asteroids.

## Getting Started

To run the game locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/asteroids-game.git

   ```

2. Open index.html (preferably using Google Chrome)

## How to play

- Use "W" to move up, "A" to move left, "S" to move down, "D" to move right.
- Press the "space" key to fire a bullet. Firing bullets is possible only while moving, in direction of movement.
- Avoid collision with asteroids (purple circles).
- Collision results in relocation of a ship.

## Controls

- "W" to move up.
- "A" to move left.
- "S" to move down.
- "D" to move right.
- "space" to fire bullet. (while in movement)
